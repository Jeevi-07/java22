wrapper class
		- every datatype has a class 
		- requests are set in the form of objects

auto boxing - primitive---> object            (from java5)

int i;
Integer obj = new Integer(i);
or Integer obj = i;

auto unboxing - primitive <--- object

int j = obj.intValue();
int j = obj;



this()
	- call constructor in the same class


Bean class
	    - to initialize object attributes by using setter and getter methods

static
	- accessed without creating an object of a class

	- static variable value can be auto incremented

	- advantage of using static block is - executed first
					     - static variable is initialized only one time


object relationship
			- HAS A = one object inside another object / 1:1, 1:m, m:n, m:1 / association

			- IS A = inheritance

super

	- in inheritance if we want to access base class variable from derived class , if the name of variable is same
	- super.a
	- also used to call base method


super()
	- constructor chaining outside the class - calling base class constructor from derived class constructor
	- super(a,b)
